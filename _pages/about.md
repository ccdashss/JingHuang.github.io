About Jing
======
I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Energy Policy at [Nicholas School of the Environment](https://nicholas.duke.edu/), [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) and the Social Science Division, [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/). I am working with [Prof. Patino-Echeverri](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/daliapatinoecheverri/people/) from Duke and [Prof. Yang](https://faculty.dukekunshan.edu.cn/faculty_profiles/yanran-yang) from DKU. 


I received my PhD from the School of Public Administration and Policy, [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/cn/about/introduce.html), in June 2024. 
With degrees in Economics and Management, my research interests encompass land use, energy policy, and decarbonization. My projects focus on the technical, economic, and public acceptance feasibility of using waste heat to reduce energy demand from residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
